# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are recorded here, in the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. The package
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

The first public release, 0.1.0, will collect everything below. Before it, the
bouncer lived in its author's dotfiles.

### Added

- MIT license and npm package metadata.
- CI on Node 22.19 and 24, and a check of the published file list.

### Changed

- The process-wide key that keeps the bouncer mode across `/reload` is now
  `Symbol.for("pi-bouncer.mode")`. A Pi process that updates the bouncer and
  then runs `/reload` drops back to normal mode once.
- The source moved under `src/`; Pi now loads `src/index.ts`. A checkout loaded
  with `pi -e <path to the checkout>` is unaffected; anything that pointed at
  `index.ts` directly must point at `src/index.ts`.
